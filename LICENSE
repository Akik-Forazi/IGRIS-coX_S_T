THE GOJO “DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT… UNLESS YOU ASK” LICENSE
(aka: Not Yours. Maybe. If You Beg.)

This work—yes, this glorious piece of code/art/chaos—is NOT free to use.
It is not public domain.
It is not open source.
It is not yours. Period.

You are not allowed to copy, modify, publish, compile, sell, share, remix, summon cursed spirits with, or do anything else to this AI archive without my explicit, written permission.

Yes, I’m talking about actual permission.
Not vibes. Not assumptions. Not “oh but it was on GitHub so I thought—”
No. Ask me.
Respectfully.
Like a decent human or a sorcerer who doesn’t want to get one-tapped by Gojo.

BUT, if you’re thinking,

> “This is amazing and I really want to use it,”
then congratulations—you have good taste.
There is a way.



You may contact me directly to request permission.
If I like you (or your cursed technique is cool enough),
I might say yes.
I might even cheer you on.
But until then?
This stays mine. All rights reserved.
Unauthorized use will be met with Gojo-level shade and potential domain expansion.

FYI:

No use without permission.

You can ask. Nicely.

I decide. No exceptions.

Gojo says: touch without consent and you’re getting sealed.
