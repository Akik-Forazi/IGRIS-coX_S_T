## About This Project

This project was built entirely on a mobile phone ‚Äî using an entry-level device with limited memory and no GPU.
From tokenizer training to model design and dataset encoding, all stages were developed and executed in a constrained environment.
Instead of relying on server-grade resources, this approach focuses on optimization, batching, and creative solutions to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible on minimal hardware.

> ‚ÄúSometimes you don‚Äôt need a supercomputer. Just a reason.‚Äù

## üë§ Built By:

**Akik Forazi**  
> Born to build from zero.  
> Trained by limitations.  
> Future overlord of the digital realm.  
> Born: July 15, 2004 | Bangladesh
